Netflix has made free streaming videos extremely simple for users of all ages. Immediately, your eyes are drawn to the red menu bar at the top of the screen with distinctive categories to allow the user to navigate through the site efficiently. The website is mainly setup in a grid-like fashion with minimal text. The content of Netflix is in essence a gallery of movie posters and shows a small window with plot information when mouse is hovering over a specific selection. This interactive feature keeps the page from being overwhelming with clutter. 

Hypem (or Hype Machine) is a great site to keep up with new and popular music. I used to follow several music blogs but later found it difficult to find the time to keep up. Hypem was perfect for it is a collection of music blogs where users can free stream and favorite songs. It keeps track of which songs have been favorited the most and organizes them based on popularity as well as break them into different categories. It integrates social media by allowing users to add friends and follow which songs they have favorited.

The homepage resembles Netflix except the red bar has been replaced with a green menu. The content is easy on the eyes with a clean white background and the title/artist clearly stated in black. A line below it displays direct links of where to download and purchase the music. It also includes an excerpt from a blog if the user wishes to gain some background knowledge on the song. The songs are separated by a wire leaving no room for confusion of where a section begins or ends.
