PLASTIQ WEB DEVELOPER TEST


Hey there, 

If you've received this test, that means we think you're a dynamite Web Developer, and we're looking forward to testing your chops a little bit.  This project is reasonably hefty - please complete it to the best of your ability.  When you come back in to chat with us, we'll take a look through your code and discuss various decisions related to your code structure and design.  Be prepared to talk about what was easy, what was hard, and what you might have done differently with the design of the UI (we love feedback!).

Best of luck!
The Plastiq Product Team
