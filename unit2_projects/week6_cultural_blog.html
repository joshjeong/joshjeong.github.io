		<h2>What Kind of Asian Are You?</h2>
			<p>Are you the kind that eats dogs? The ones that are good at math? The bad drivers? The slacker? The hacker? or are you the one always playing Pokemon? The Asian stereotype has meshed different ethnicities into one cohesive group which is evident in today's media such as movies and television shows. We are often portrayed as the geek next door with the thick framed glasses that aren't cool in a hipster way. Stereotype is a big threat that is often overlooked. It creates negative prejudice towards a group of people ofen causing prejudgement of one's character.</p>

			<p>I am a Korean American but at times it feels as if I'm neither. The country I live in neither recognizes my Korean culture as being a separate entity from the broader classification of "Asian" nor do I look the part of an All American boy. Stereotyping hampers the growth of ethnic groups and supresses them to feel subordinate.</p>

			<p>Instead, we should step away from labels. I have experienced stereotyping and borderline  racism; it's not the best feeling but there are certainly worse things in life. It was demeaning and negative to my self esteem. It makes you cloud your judgement often with anger and resentment. I have no problem sharing my two cents, however, sometimes approaching a conflict head on is not the best strategy. I found that making light of a situation then explaining to them what is wrong is the best way to resolve this kind of conflict.</p>
