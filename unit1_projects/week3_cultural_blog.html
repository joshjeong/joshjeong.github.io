		<h2>Week 3: Pairing </h2>
			<p>Before Dev Bootcamp, a majority of my self studies was spent scratching my head or yelling at my screen as if my programming error was my computer’s fault. Coding obstacles were hard to overcome; I would have a difficult time debugging or fully grasping a concept. Pairing has been a refreshing take. It’s been a great experience talking issues out and gaining another perspective- two minds are truly better than one. </p>
			<p>Feedback has been insightful. It’s not like the instructor’s have been demoralizing me, but instead, have been providing constructive criticism. They have pointed out that I need to be more vocal when I get stuck with an issue which is completely true. I need to be able to think aloud so that my partner and I may be on the same page. I want to implement this change as soon as possible but it is a skill that continuously needs to be improved.</p>
			<p>Writing feedback has been difficult because the people I have worked with have been more than helpful. I feel it is hard to rate others especially when we are all in a learning process. Overall, I love the pairing experience and look forward to future sessions.</p>
