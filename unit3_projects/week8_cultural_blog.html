		<h2>Website Reboot</h2>
			<p>I have always been a fan of clean and simple designs. I wanted to create a blog site that would be easy to read yet not be boring. To achieve this, I decided to start from scratch and mock up a new snazzy wireframe.</p>
			<img src= "../images/blog_wireframe.png" width= "100%">
			<p>Being extremely new to coding, there were a few goals I had in mind for my blog revamp. One of the things on my list was to have an image appear at the banner whenever the user hovered over one of the menu options. I found that this could be achieved by doing some inline Javascript codes such as ‘onmouseover’ and ‘onmouseout’. Second task on my checklist was to really utilize CSS classes. I noticed I had so many things repeating and could really use a good refactor.  Next, I wanted to improve my containing skills. My previous blog had content floating around in random places and nothing was where it was supposed to be. It was a lot easier this time around which was extremely encouraging.</p> 
			<p>Overall, I had a blast creating this template. Being able to build something that was based on something in my mind is one of the main reasons I was eager to join DBC. I love coding because it is a great creative outlet when equipped with the right tools and knowledge. I’m excited to take this further in the next couple of months!</p>
			<br>

			<h2>Things I’d Like to Improve:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Banner image goes behind blog title</li>
				<li>Images fade in/ fade out</li>
				<li>Expand/ Collapse blog links</li>
			</ul>
